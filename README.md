## Overview

#### COURSE DESCRIPTION
In the words of Ernesto Oroza in Technological Disobedience - "Más severa es la crisis, más poderosa es la creatividad de las personas” (The more severe the crisis, the more powerful is the creativity of the people).
In this special format of Project Development Studio, students will look into techniques and frameworks to design and develop projects with limited resources during turbulent times.

This is a production heavy four-credit course, where students will be required to propose a single project that will be researched and expanded during the semester utilizing creative practices that exist outside of the mainstream.

#### COURSE SCHEDULE
The course will meet once per week, on Mondays, for a total of 12 weeks. Students are also required to book at least 1 one-on-one session with the instructor during the semester.

#### ASSIGNMENTS & Deliverables
There will be regular deliverables that are relevant to the class material. Your process must be documented (written description, photos, screenshots, screen recording and video all qualify based on the assignment) on the class blog. Each deliverable is due by class time one week after they are assigned unless stated otherwise.

It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching videos, developing your project and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.

Each deliverable will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation. If significant portions are simply not attempted or the assignment is turned in late (up to 1 week) then it may be marked partially complete. If it is more than a week late, not turned in, or an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.

Grading will follow the same guidelines as above; on time and meeting the criteria specified will be marked as complete. Late (up to 1 week) or partially completed work will be given half credit. Work that is more than a week late, not turned in, or fails to meet the criteria specified will be given no credit.
